<itunes:subtitle>Nick Vujicic - STAND STRONG Most Powerful Speech</itunes:subtitle>
<itunes:summary> <![CDATA[ Nick Vujicic: STAND STRONG (Most Powerful Speech)
ABOUT STAND STRONG

With no arms, no legs, and no defense, Nick Vujicic was once a bully’s target and knows what it feels like to be picked on and pushed around:  It makes your stomach hurt, gives you nightmares, and feels like there is no hope in sight. But Nick shows how you too can overcome and rise above bullying.




No Bully Can Define Who You Are

Nick has experienced bullying of all kinds for being “different.” But he’s learned that he doesn’t have to play the bully’s game–and neither do you. In Stand Strong Nick gives you strategies for developing a “bully defense system,” so you can handle bullies of all kinds by building your strength from the inside out.




Find out how to:

·     Turn being bullied into a great opportunity (yes, really!)

·     Create a safety zone within yourself

·     Establish strong values that no bully can shake

·     Deal with cyber bullies

·     Develop a spiritual foundation to stay strong against bullying

·     Monitor your emotions and control your response to them

·     Help others who are being bullied

Are you facing the unwanted attention of a bully?  You can stand up to the challenge, because you have greater power over your feelings and your life than you may think! Just ask Nick–the man with no arms or legs…and “a ridiculously good life.”

'PURPOSE' (ft.Will Smith) - Motivational video | Arnold Schwarzenegger | Jim Carrey inspiring speech
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlmPe3Jdmlk

Many of us, as we were growing up, learned to ignore our inner experience and instead we learned to focus on others. Our ego wounded self learned to tune into what others were feeling in the hopes of having control over feeling safe.

Where you put your focus depends upon on what you believe makes you feel happy and safe. If you believe that your happiness and safety come from others liking you, connecting with you, approving of you, loving you, or spending time with you, then your focus is likely to be on others.

If you believe that your happiness and safety come from connecting with yourself and with your higher guidance, and from approving of yourself, defining your own worth, spending time with yourself, taking loving action for yourself, and sharing your love and caring with others, then your focus is likely to be within. In other words, if you believe your happiness and safety come from getting love, your focus will be on others. If you believe your happiness and safety come from being loving with yourself and others, your focus will be within.

<itunes:subtitle>Elon Musk - 18 Laws of Success Motivational Video</itunes:subtitle>
<itunes:summary> <![CDATA[ Elon Musk: 18 Laws of Success (Motivational Video)
Elon Musk is the co-founder, CEO and Product Architect at Tesla, overseeing all product development, engineering, and design of the company's electric vehicles, battery products, and solar roofs.

Since the company’s inception in 2003, Tesla’s mission has been to accelerate the transition to a sustainable energy future. The first Tesla product, the Roadster sports car, debuted in 2008, followed by the Model S Sedan, which was introduced in 2012, and the Model X SUV, which launched in 2015. Model S was named Motor Trend 2013 Car of the Year, received Consumer Reports’ Best Overall Car and earned the highest-ever safety rating awarded by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. In 2017, Tesla will begin deliveries of Model 3, a $35,000 mass-market electric car with over 215 miles of range.

In 2015, Tesla introduced two energy storage products, the Powerwall home battery and the Powerpack industrial-scale battery. In 2016, Tesla acquired SolarCity, the leading provider of solar power systems in the United States, and in 2017 will release the Solar Roof, a beautiful and affordable energy generation product.

Elon is also the co-founder, CEO, and lead designer of Space Exploration Technologies (SpaceX), where he oversees the development and manufacturing of advanced rockets and spacecraft for missions to and beyond Earth orbit, with the goal of creating a self-sustaining city on Mars. He is also the co-founder and chairman of OpenAI, a non-profit research company working to build safe artificial intelligence and ensure that AI's benefits are as widely and evenly distributed as possible.

Previously, Elon co-founded and sold PayPal, the world's leading Internet payment system, and Zip2, one of the first internet maps and directions services, which helped bring major publishers like the New York Times and Hearst online.

<itunes:subtitle>Take Care of Yourself FIRST Tony Robbins Jim Rohn Les Brown Jada Pinkett Smith</itunes:subtitle>
<itunes:summary> <![CDATA[ Take Care of Yourself FIRST (Tony Robbins, Jim Rohn, Les Brown, Jada Pinkett Smith)

Speakers:
Jada Pinkett Smith
Tony Robbins
Jim Rohn
Les Brown

Do you tend to control the events in your life, or are events controlling you? The amount of stress you feel is directly related to how in control you feel about your life.

It’s easy to let other things take control of us – unless we take control of our own minds. What we choose to focus on has a massive effect on how we feel. If you focus on the things you can’t control – such as the past, or what’s missing from your life – you feel stressed, overwhelmed, and depressed. Even if you’re taking antidepressants, you’re still going to feel depressed if you’re focusing on the things in your life that are out of your control!

Leaders focus on what they can control, what they have, and what they want. Once you change your focus in this way, you will become a creator again, instead of just a manager of your life. It’s easy to lose that vision as you experience disappointments along the way. We’ve all been there – life seems to crush something that you were excited about, or someone betrays you, or you betray yourself.
“Focus on where you want to go not on what you fear”

To create a life where you’re thriving, not just surviving, you must focus on creating a compelling future. Pick anything – a goal, dream, or desire – that you want so much, you’re going to find yourself compelled to make it happen.

The great thing is, if you think about it, you’ve actually already done this before. Whether or not you’ve been keeping track of it along the way, there are things that you’ve wanted and have gotten for yourself. You are responsible for everything that you have in your life today. If you want to thrive, you have to focus on the things you can control, the difference you can make, and the things that are already in your life that you’re grateful for.

<description> <![CDATA[ Take Care of Yourself FIRST (Tony Robbins, Jim Rohn, Les Brown, Jada Pinkett Smith)

Speakers:
Jada Pinkett Smith
Tony Robbins
Jim Rohn
Les Brown

Do you tend to control the events in your life, or are events controlling you? The amount of stress you feel is directly related to how in control you feel about your life.

It’s easy to let other things take control of us – unless we take control of our own minds. What we choose to focus on has a massive effect on how we feel. If you focus on the things you can’t control – such as the past, or what’s missing from your life – you feel stressed, overwhelmed, and depressed. Even if you’re taking antidepressants, you’re still going to feel depressed if you’re focusing on the things in your life that are out of your control!

Leaders focus on what they can control, what they have, and what they want. Once you change your focus in this way, you will become a creator again, instead of just a manager of your life. It’s easy to lose that vision as you experience disappointments along the way. We’ve all been there – life seems to crush something that you were excited about, or someone betrays you, or you betray yourself.
“Focus on where you want to go not on what you fear”

To create a life where you’re thriving, not just surviving, you must focus on creating a compelling future. Pick anything – a goal, dream, or desire – that you want so much, you’re going to find yourself compelled to make it happen.

The great thing is, if you think about it, you’ve actually already done this before. Whether or not you’ve been keeping track of it along the way, there are things that you’ve wanted and have gotten for yourself. You are responsible for everything that you have in your life today. If you want to thrive, you have to focus on the things you can control, the difference you can make, and the things that are already in your life that you’re grateful for.

<itunes:summary> <![CDATA[ FIND YOURSELF (BEST MOTIVATIONAL VIDEO 2018)
Figuring out who we are and what we want out of life can be challenging if at any point you, like me, veered off the course of self-exploration and self-acceptance.

But eventually, life smacks us in the face enough times that we’re forced to admit the truth: we’re totally lost.

In that moment, there is surrender to something much bigger than our individual selves, and we start this journey again. Only this time, we’re present; we’re tuned in to what’s up, and we’re ready.

The path to figuring it all out requires a determination to stay committed to the trail, to hang on and keep moving forward, even when it gets tough – which it does. We travel to our darkest depths inside ourselves and see everything we’ve hidden, covered up, locked, and repressed.

It all surfaces and it’s a wild ride. But, there’s a light at the end of the tunnel: our perspectives about our selves and this life shift tremendously and open the doors for some miraculous opportunities, love, and peace.

I’ve learned some of these lessons the hard way, but once I learned them, life became a lot clearer and the road to wherever I’m going piqued by becoming effortless and enjoyable in more moments than not. There are still times that arise which aren’t so picturesque, I’m just better equipped to ride that rocky wave and can remind myself to settle into what I know.

<itunes:subtitle>How to Love Yourself AGAIN Motivational Video</itunes:subtitle>
<itunes:summary> <![CDATA[ How to Love Yourself AGAIN (Motivational Video)
When people start to love themselves more each day, it’s amazing how their lives get better. They feel better. They get the jobs they want. They have the money they need. Their relationships either improve, or the negative ones dissolve and new ones begin.

It’s a very simple premise—loving yourself. I’ve been criticized for being too simplistic, and I have found that the simple things are usually the most profound.

Someone said to me recently, “You gave me the most wonderful gift—you gave me the gift of myself.” So many of us hide from ourselves and we don’t even know who we are. We don’t know what we feel, we don’t know what we want.

Life is a voyage of self discovery. To me, to be enlightened is to go within and to know who and what we really are, and to know that we have the ability to change for the better by loving and taking care of ourselves.

It’s not selfish to love ourselves. It clears us so that we can love ourselves enough to love other people. We can really help the planet when we come from a space of great love and joy on an individual basis.

The Power that created this incredible Universe has often been referred to as love. God is love. We have often heard the statement: Love makes the world go ’round. It’s all true. Love is the binding agent that holds the whole Universe together.

To me, love is a deep appreciation. When I talk about loving ourselves, I mean having a deep appreciation for who we are. We accept all the different parts of ourselves—our little peculiarities, the embarrassments, the things we may not do so well, and all the wonderful qualities, too.

Jim Kwik is a globally recognized leader in memory improvement, brain performance, and accelerated learning. In his lifetime, he’s sustained two traumatic brain injuries that left him with significant learning disabilities. But despite the obstacles he had to overcome in recovery, he became obsessed with the brain and its superpower-like capabilities. He has now turned his obsession into a revolutionary accelerated learning system that has helped numerous celebrity clients and students in over 150 countries. Jim Kwik sits down with Tom Bilyeu to discuss intriguing insights in hacking the brain in this week’s episode of Impact Theory.

Tom Bilyeu is the co-founder of 2014 Inc. 500 company Quest Nutrition — a unicorn startup valued at over $1 billion — and the co-founder and host of Impact Theory. Impact Theory is a first-of-its-kind company designed to facilitate global change through the incubation of mission-based businesses and the cultivation of empowering content. Every piece of content Impact Theory creates is meant to underscore the company mission to free people from The Matrix and help them unlock their true potential. Impact Theory exists to inspire the next generation of game-changing companies and creators that will make a true and lasting impact on the world.

You should be grateful for your past. The good times and especially the challenging times, because all of it formed who you are today.
Be grateful for the hard times in your past, grateful for the lessons, grateful for the strength it gave you. Then, DECIDE that your FUTURE is more important than holding on. Let go of any negativity towards your past, people or events, and FOCUS on building your greatest ever future.

<itunes:summary> <![CDATA[ CONTROL YOUR THINKING (MOTIVATIONAL VIDEO 2018)
Many people fail to go after what they want in life because they think their best days are behind them. It's NEVER TOO LATE to create your best ever life. No matter what age you are, no matter how many past failures, it is NEVER TOO LATE.
It's NEVER TOO LATE because SUCCESS is all in the mind. You can define success however you like, so as long as you have the ability to control your mind you have the ability to create your best ever life.

If it is financial or material success you are seeking, it is never too late for that either.
You are only a google click away from a world full of late success stories. Some of the greatest, most successful humans on the planet only made it big later in life.
Never give up, you are capable of anything you can imagine.

<itunes:summary> <![CDATA[ Jack Ma: THIS IS WHY YOU FAIL (Motivational Video 2018).
Alibaba’s Jack Ma, China’s second-richest man, visits Obama at the White House

When it comes to solving really hard problems, Ma has a famous quote that I love: Today is hard. Tomorrow will be worse. But the day after that will be beautiful. Most of your talent won't make it past tomorrow. But as a leader, you must inspire people through those hardest times: To stick with it, to move through it, and to see past it so they can make it to the day where things are beautiful. That's when you're really innovating. You have get your team there.

I'm a dropout of Harvard Business School, but I took a very helpful leadership class while I was there that really stuck with me. We discussed looking at problems from every angle, and looking at the person inside the puzzle. See their picture, their concern, their point of view, and understand that people feel passionately the way they do. Your job is to see the 360º and come up with the answers.

On the flip side, you have to balance this by pushing people to their boundaries. How do you get there, if most people don't make it past Jack Ma's tomorrow? You ache to get talent to do things they've never done before. And that's hard.

<itunes:summary> <![CDATA[ Thank you to Tom Bilyeu for providing the amazing interview and speech!
Check out his awesome channel here: https://www.youtube.com/TomBilyeu


You don’t have to be a rocket scientist to understand the struggles of growing up in South Central, Los Angeles. Olympia Lepoint was stabbed in the face by a young gang member and at times ate only ice because her family could not afford food. Though she failed every level of high school math, her insane work ethic landed here in the top five of her college class --with a degree in mathematics. Her struggle continued as a woman of color in a male-dominated world. Despite facing hazing and discrimination on every hand, she found a way to leverage her talent and drive to become an award-winning rocket scientist who helped NASA launch 28 space missions. Meet the woman that People Magazine named the modern day Hidden Figure in this thought-provoking episode of Impact Theory with Tom Bilyeu.
